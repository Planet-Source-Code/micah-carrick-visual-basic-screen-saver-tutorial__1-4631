This is old... like 1999 old. Also, The HTML version is at http://www.micahcarrick.com/v2/content/view/10/3/

I hear it doesn't work in XP. Anybody know why?
 
### More Info
 
This is for anyone who is a beginner at making screen savers, as it does not get into the more complex tasks of preview and high end graphics. Anyone curious as to how to make thier own saver.
